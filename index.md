Hi. My name is Alyson Matecki and I am a junior in highschool. I enjoy baking, cooking, playing online games, and walking. I started to bake and cook when I was 6-years-old, so I have a lot of expierience in the kitchen: around 10 years. Ever since I was in elementary school, I played online games that were centered around logic since I enjoy problem solving. Currently, I have been playing one game which is all about strategizing and teamwork. Walking is a hobby that I enjoy most when I am with my family. We have walked through parks, mountains, and forests all around New Jersey as well as in other states. For example, I hiked up Stone Mountain in Georgia in 2019.
